# Universal React

**Note:** This package is still in development but will be released soon.

Too many starters kits are opinionated about things developers like to solve themselves - CSS, layout, test frameworks, state architecture (e.g. Flux). This boilerplate instead focuses on hard-to-solve universal (A.K.A isomorphic) problems. Namely title and meta for routes, universal routing, and universal data fetching and rehydration on the client.

##Â Features

- Universal routing
- Hot reloading
- Universal title & meta
- Universal data fetching/rehydration on the client
- 100% React components (no Jade, Handlebars etc for the server)
